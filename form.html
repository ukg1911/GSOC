    <h2>Proposed Summer Project</h2>
    <p>This project aims to develop a Bluetooth/BLE component for MIT App Inventor, enabling visual, drag-and-drop IoT development. It will simplify communication with IoT devices (e.g., ESP32, Raspberry Pi) by providing high-level blocks for scanning, connecting, and reading/writing data. The project will feature a GWT-based designer interface, backend support for Android and iOS, and comprehensive documentation/tutorials to help users get started.</p>

    <h2>Experience with the Development Tools</h2>
    <h3>Java</h3>
    <p>I have used Java in multiple academic and personal projects, including Android app development. I’m familiar with object-oriented programming, Android Studio, and working with Bluetooth APIs. Example: <a href="https://github.com/yourusername/ble-temp-sensor">BLE Temperature Monitor App (Java)</a>.</p>

    <h3>Swift</h3>
    <p>As part of my learning, I have explored Swift and developed small apps using Xcode to experiment with CoreBluetooth. I’ve worked on a sample BLE scanner for iOS and documented the process. Example: <a href="https://github.com/yourusername/ble-ios-scanner">BLE iOS Scanner (Swift)</a>.</p>

    <h3>GWT</h3>
    <p>While I am new to GWT, I have studied its integration in MIT App Inventor’s codebase and am currently experimenting with UI property editors. I am confident in my ability to work with GWT through documentation and mentorship guidance.</p>

    <h3>App Inventor Codebase</h3>
    <p>I’ve explored the open-source repository of MIT App Inventor, including the way components and designer properties are structured. I’m comfortable navigating and modifying code within large open-source projects.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Experience with Teams, Online Developer Communities, and Large Codebases</h2>
    <p>As an intern, I have worked in agile teams to build and test application modules, often collaborating using Git and platforms like GitHub. I actively participate in developer communities, contribute to open-source issues, and help peers debug their code. I’ve also worked on team-based academic projects with version control and documentation workflows.</p>
